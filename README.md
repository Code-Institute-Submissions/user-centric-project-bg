#User Centric Project BG

##Title: Patient Self-Service"
'Patient Self-Service' will provide an unique service to patients commencing with two key features - appointments and prescriptions. 
This website will give patients the flexibility to schedule appointments and order their prescriptions at a time that suits them. Responsive design will allow users use a device of their choice. 
It will provide a platform to rollout additional enhancements in the near future.

##UX
This website is for everyone and especially patients who attend their GP on a regular basis. These patients will also have their medicine prescribed on a <frequency> basis. Patients nowadays use alot of different devices and are very comforable carrying out various activities online. Users want a positive experience when interacting online, they want not only an intuitive website but one that is easy to use and enjoyable.
