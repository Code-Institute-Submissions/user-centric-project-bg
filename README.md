# User Centric Project BG

# Project Name: Patient Self-Service
'Patient Self-Service' will provide an unique service to patients commencing with two key features - appointments and prescriptions. This website will give patients the flexibility to schedule appointments and order their prescriptions at a time that suits them. Responsive design will allow users use a device of their choice. 
It will provide a platform to rollout additional enhancements in the near future.  <br/>This project was deployed to the live website using 'GH Pages' - https://gallaghb.github.io/user-centric-project-bg/

## UX
This website is for everyone and especially patients who attend their GP on a regular basis. These patients will also have their medicine prescribed on a frequency basis. Patients nowadays use alot of different devices and are very comforable carrying out various activities online. Users want a positive experience when interacting online, they want not only an intuitive website but one that is easy to use and enjoyable.<br/>
The list of User Stories are as follows:

    • As a User, I want to be able to navigate easily between menu items, so that I will want to return to this site as it's intuitive and easy to use
    • As a User, I want	consistency across the site I'm visiting, so that it is easy to use
    • As a User, I want	to be able to click on links to external sites,	so that	I don't have to seperate web searches
    • As a User, I want	external links to open in a seperate browser, so that I can easily return to the main site

    • As a User, I want	to be able to make an appointment with my GP online, so that I choose a date and time that suits me
    • As a User, I want	to order my monthly prescriptions online, so that "I don't have to:-ring GP to order prescription, -call to GP Surgery to collect prescription, -drop prescription to pharmacy,-wait at pharmacy until prescription is ready"
    • As a User, I want	to view your website on my mobile, so that I can book appointments or order prescriptions no matter where I am 
    • As a User, I want	to view your website on my tablet, so that I can use a device of my preference
